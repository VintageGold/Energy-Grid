Abstract:

Past research and studies have shown that there is a correlation between weather temperatures and energy usage and outage. It is crucial to analyze how weather conditions and temperature can potentially affect consumerâ€™s energy consumption which can potentially increase the number of electricity outages. A model successful at predicting future outages by region based previous weather trends and patterns will prove to be useful in that it will allow consumers to be aware of the possibility of outages to occur and prepare for the consequences of the outages. PJM  has recorded an average of  2,812 megawatt outage loss across the Mid Atlantic- Dominion region, which is equivalent to approximately 93,609 homes, constituting 15% of Baltimore City, Maryland population. Using weather data from NOAA and energy usage and energy outage data from PJM, we conducted a daily time series analysis and utilized exploratory data analysis techniques on Single Output Time series forecasting using Linear Regression, Multi-layer Perceptron, Multi-step Dense, Convolution Neural Network, and Long Short Term Memory (LTSM). Tensorflow proved to be an advantageous guide in our analysis to develop and determine the most effective models that can predict future outages in the Mid Atlantic- Dominion region based on past weather patterns and trends. Our time series analysis involved concatenating our three datasets: weather, energy usage, and energy outage. Due to the difference in how PJM recorded and reported outage data compared to the usage data, our time series analysis resulted in discrepancies that proposed more questions and encouraged further research into the difficulty of weather prediction. Weather forecasting is a complex study for which further research and extensive analysis will be required.
